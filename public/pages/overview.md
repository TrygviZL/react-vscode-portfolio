# ðŸ“– Overview

## Summary

Data Engineer with a Software Engineering mindset and experience within cloud and pharma.
As more and more companies move towards being data-centric, the need for organized and accessible data is ever increasing. With my experience within pharma, AWS, data engineering and software development, I have the toolkit to solve even the most tricky challenges.

## Experience

**Data Engineer** @ [H. Lundbeck A/S](https://www.lundbeck.com) _(Aug 2020 - Current)_
As a Data Platform Engineer I am responsible for maintaining data tooling and infrastructure to suppor the business in their data needs. 
Technologies: Snowflake, dbt, Snowflake, Terraform, Typescript

&nbsp;

**Data Engineering Graduate** @ [H. Lundbeck A/S](https://www.lundbeck.com) _(Sep 2020 - Aug 2022)_
Graduate at the Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics department in a role as a Cloud Data Engineer.
As a data engineer, my primary responsibilities are:
- Architecting and development of data platform on AWS 
- Creating CI/CD pipeline for deploying AWS infrastructure using GitHub Actions and AWS CDK
- Defining, creating, maintaining and monitoring of data pipelines
- Training and deploying ML/statistical models
- Ad-Hoc data analysis to solve usecases in pharmaceutical manufacturing for root-cause analysis and process optimization
- Developing IoT solutions for manufacturing usecases
Technologies: S3, Lambda, Kinesis, Athena, StepFunctions, CDK, SQS, IoT-Core, Snowflake

**Bioinformatician / Computational Biology** @ [H. Lundbeck A/S](https://www.lundbeck.com) _(Mar 2020 - Sep 2020)_
Supporting early drug development using data analysis and modelling methods. I was tasked with developing mechanistic and stochastic models to simulate the interaction between drug and target to predict predict future results and gain additional insight from experiments. My tasks include:
- Mathematical modelling using ODEs and Stochastic Models (Monte Carlo Simulation) to simulate drug-target interaction
- Analysis and prediction of experimental results
- Support planning of clinical studies based on data-analysis and simulation)

## Education

`202-2022` [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk)
- **Focus areas:** Mathematical modelling and data analysis with focus on medical and biological applications. Topics include programming, fluid mechanics, mass transport, signal processing, statistics and machine learning.
- **Thesis** (Grade 12/12): Local coupling of dopamine neaurons. Project was in collaboration with the Danish pharmaceutical company H. Lundbeck A/S and was aimed a investigating the mechanism of dopamine in coupling and synchronization of neurons in the midbrain. 

`2014â€“2017` [Techincal University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk)
- This study is a joint programme run by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the University of Copenhagen (KU). This study includes combines courses within biology and pathology with classical engineering courses such as electronics, signal analysis, and material science.
- **Thesis** (Grade 12/12): Cell-on-a-Disc: A Centrifugal microfludic platform for perfusion cell culture. Project was continued by a PhD student and published in [American Chemical Society](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02582)
