**Bioinformatician / Computational Biology** @ [H. Lundbeck A/S](https://www.lundbeck.com) _(Mar 2020 - Sep 2020)_

Supporting early drug development using data analysis and modelling methods. I was tasked with developing mechanistic and stochastic models to simulate the interaction between drug and target to predict predict future results and gain additional insight from experiments. My tasks include:
- Mathematical modelling using ODEs and Stochastic Models (Monte Carlo Simulation) to simulate drug-target interaction
- Analysis and prediction of experimental results
- Support planning of clinical studies based on data-analysis and simulation)
