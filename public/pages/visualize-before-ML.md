# Visualize data before talking about ML and AI

tl;dr Getting business people to look at data with their eyeballs will often solve more business problems than any ML model could ever do.

Multiple times have I been in projects aimed at supporting the business using ML or data analysis methods. While these have had good intentions, I have later found them to miss the mark entirely with a lot of oppurtunity cost. The projects have usually went something like this:

1) Figure out what business problem to solve.
2) Find the relevant data in whatever ERP, SaaS, or other system.
3) Fetch data from these systems.
4) combine and analyze data in python, sql or similar.
5) Train ML model
6) If needed, deploy ML model for usage

When presenting the ML model or analysis results to the stakeholders, the first response is usually: "Oh you have access to the data, can I get that?". After some questioning pople usually just want a dashboard showing the data or access via Excel where they can play around with the data themselves.
