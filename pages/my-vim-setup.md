# ðŸ’» My minimal-ish .vimrc for Typescript development
## Introduction
You can probably find hundreds of .vimrc around and in then end it is up to the user to figure out a setup that works. This .vimrc file is inspired by Gary Bernhardt who was a guest in the Changelog Podcast episode [Why we ðŸ’š vim](https://changelog.com/podcast/450). In his [.vimrc](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc) Gary has a BASIC EDITING CONFIGURATION block which contains various configurations to make vim a bit more modern. As for extensions, I have tried to make it minimal with 12 plugins, most of which are solely for language support.

## Upgrade VIM to v9 on WSL
The standard version of VIM that WSL ships with does not support the Coc language server. Below is a bash script that installs the latest version of vim, installs Nodejs as dependency and fetches the [.vimrc](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/main/.vimrc) and [coc-settings.json](https://github.com/TrygviZL/my-dotfiles/blob/main/coc-settings.json).
